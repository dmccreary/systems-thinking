# Bank Balance

Here is a causal loop diagram for an interest-earning bank account using two nodes in a clockwise direction.

## Causal Loop Diagram: Interest-Earning Bank Account

### Nodes:
1. **Bank Balance** (positioned at top) - The total amount of money in the account
2. **Interest Earned** (positioned at bottom) - The interest income generated by the account

### Causal Relationships (Clockwise):

**Bank Balance → Interest Earned** (Positive/Same Direction)
- **Description**: A higher bank balance generates more interest income
- **Mechanism**: Most savings accounts calculate interest as a percentage of the account balance (e.g., 2% annual percentage yield)
- **Strength**: Strong - directly proportional relationship
- **Example**: $10,000 balance at 2% APY earns $200/year, while $20,000 earns $400/year

**Interest Earned → Bank Balance** (Positive/Same Direction)  
- **Description**: Interest earnings are deposited back into the account, increasing the total balance
- **Mechanism**: Interest payments (monthly, quarterly, or annually) are added to the principal
- **Strength**: Strong - all interest directly increases balance
- **Delay**: Present - typically 1 month to 1 year depending on compounding frequency

### Loop Characteristics:

**Loop Type**: Reinforcing (R)
- This creates compound growth where interest earns interest

**Behavior Pattern**: Exponential growth over time
- The account balance grows at an accelerating rate due to compounding

**Time Dynamics**: 
- Short-term: Growth appears linear
- Long-term: Growth becomes noticeably exponential, especially with higher interest rates

### Mathematical Relationship:
This represents the fundamental compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r)^t, where the feedback loop creates the compounding effect that makes final amounts greater than simple interest calculations.

**Real-World Example**: 
Starting with $1,000 at 5% annual interest compounded annually:
- Year 1: $1,000 → $50 interest → $1,050 balance
- Year 2: $1,050 → $52.50 interest → $1,102.50 balance  
- Year 3: $1,102.50 → $55.13 interest → $1,157.63 balance

The reinforcing loop ensures each cycle produces slightly more interest than the previous cycle, creating the compounding effect.
