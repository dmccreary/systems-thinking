# About This Website and Book

## Background

I was originally introduced to formal Systems Thinking and Complex Adaptive Systems by
my good friend [Arun Batchu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunbatchu/).
Arun and I were always talking about the power of taking a deeper
look not just about things but the connections between things.

I have been teaching systems thinking courses arund 2015.
However, my content was mostly focused around large PowerPoint slide decks.

Most of my work was teaching Systems Thinking to technologists.
In 2017 I started to migrate my content to an on-line format
and I started to roll out more formal classes to managers and executives
at Optum and United Health Group.

When GPT-3 was released in June 2020 I began aggressively
using it to generate causal information.  Although it could
not create high-quality causal loop diagrams, I was convinced
that there was deep causal knowledge buried in LLMs.  Our
jobs was to just figure out a way to get in out and make
it useful to students of systems thinking.

In 2022 I was asked to [deliver a workshop on Graph Systems Thinking](https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/blog/speakers/dan-mccreary/).
This was one of my first chances to help other graph evangelists build a deeply holistic view of information in an organization.

At UHG/Optum I was also been asked to apply systems thinking to break down organizational silos and share
data across business areas.  I want to give my deep appreciation to [John Santelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-santelli-331ab5274/) (then the CIO of Optum) for his
support rolling out my Systems Thinking courses to management at UHG and Oputm.

You will find many resources on these topics as well
as how to accelerate the adoption of
Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) in your organization.

## Relationship Between Systems Thinking and Enterprise Knowledge Graphs

I believe strongly that many business people in Fortune 500 organizations today only have a pinhole view of
information flows in their organization.  This prevents them from understanding how their products
compete with competitive product and impact their customers and their organizational effectiveness. 

That is what the new enterprise knowledge graph (EKG) industry is creating for organizations.  The hypothesis of this book is that the old ways of problem solving with relational databases will not work at the scale of EKGs.  We need new ways to think.  Systems Thinking is the foundation of this new generation of problem solving tools.

## Audience

This book in intended for the following audience:

1. People that are trying to use Systems Thinking as a tool to promote Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs)
1. People trying to understand the potential strategic impact of EKGs on large organizations.
2. People that are attempting to debug the common glitches in adoption of EKGs as a central strategic platform for organizational sustainability.

Looking at the constraints of the past and realizing they are not the same constraints of the future.

There is no programming or math background required for this book, although familiarity with drawing tools and online shared waterboarding tools is encouraged.

## Our Values

We value storytelling and the use of metaphors to help us communicate with non-technical staff.

## Book Structure

The book is broken down into three parts.

### Part 1: Introduction

**Chapter 1: [Introduction](ch-01-intro.md)** - what was once too expensive is now affordable
**Chapter 2: [Graphs](ch-02-graph.md)** - Where are enterprise knowledge graphs as why are they central to future organizational strategy
**Chapter 3: [Systems Thinking](ch-03-systems.md)** - What is Systems Thinking?  Why is a good tool for EKG analysis?
**Chapter 4: [Graph and Systems Thinking](ch-04-systems-graph.md)** - Applying Systems Thinking to Graph Adoption 

### Part 2: Case Studies
These will be detailed stories of how teams have used systems thinking to promote graph adoption.

### Part 3: Advanced Concepts
We will dive into advanced topics such as graph-based machine learning, cognitive bias and storytelling to promote good systems thinking best practices.
