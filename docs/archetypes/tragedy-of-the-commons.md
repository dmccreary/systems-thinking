# Tragedy of the Commons

Tragedy of the Commons is perhaps the most fundamental archetype we teach first. 
Tragedy of the Commons demonstrates how individual rational decisions can lead to 
collective irrationality and system collapse. The Tragedy of the Commons archetype 
helps students understand shared resource depletion, environmental issues, and organizational 
challenges where individual incentives conflict with group benefits.
