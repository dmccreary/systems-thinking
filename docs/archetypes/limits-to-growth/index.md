# Limits to Growth

**Limits to Growth** shows us how exponential growth eventually encounters constraints, 
leading to overshoot and collapse. This archetype is essential for understanding sustainability, 
resource management, and why systems can't grow indefinitely.

## Examples of Limits to Growth

### Human Population on Planet Earth

### Bacterial colonies

### Moore's Law

### Chip Clock Rate and the Power Wall

### AI Capabilities
