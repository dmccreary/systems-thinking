# Introductory Archetypes

## Core Foundation Archetypes

### Tragedy of the Commons
**Tragedy of the Commons** is perhaps the most fundamental archetype to teach first. It demonstrates how individual rational decisions can lead to collective irrationality and system collapse. This archetype helps students understand shared resource depletion, environmental issues, and organizational challenges where individual incentives conflict with group benefits.

**Limits to Growth** shows students how exponential growth eventually encounters constraints, leading to overshoot and collapse. This archetype is essential for understanding sustainability, resource management, and why systems can't grow indefinitely.

**Fixes that Fail** teaches students about unintended consequences and short-term thinking. It demonstrates how quick fixes often create larger problems down the road, making it crucial for understanding policy decisions and organizational problem-solving.

## Interactive Dynamics Archetypes

**Success to the Successful** illustrates how initial advantages compound over time, creating winner-take-all dynamics. This helps students understand inequality, market concentration, and why fair competition becomes increasingly difficult.

**Shifting the Burden** shows how addressing symptoms rather than root causes creates dependency and weakens problem-solving capacity. This archetype is vital for understanding addiction, organizational dysfunction, and policy failures.

## Learning-Oriented Archetypes

**The AI Flywheel** (as mentioned in your glossary) represents how feedback loops create competitive advantages through data accumulation. This modern archetype helps students understand platform economics and network effects.

**Accidental Adversaries** demonstrates how well-intentioned parties can create conflict through misunderstanding system structure, making it valuable for organizational and interpersonal dynamics.

## Why These Matter for Beginners

These archetypes work well for introductory teaching because they:

- Connect to familiar real-world examples students can easily recognize
- Demonstrate core systems concepts like feedback loops, delays, and nonlinear relationships
- Show both reinforcing and balancing loops in action
- Illustrate how structure drives behavior
- Help students recognize patterns across different domains (business, environment, personal life)

Starting with **Tragedy of the Commons** and **Limits to Growth** provides a solid foundation, then building complexity with the interactive dynamics archetypes helps students develop systems intuition before tackling more specialized patterns.
