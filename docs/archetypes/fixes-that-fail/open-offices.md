# Fixes that Fail: Open Office Plans to Improve Collaboration

Here's a workplace design example of the "Fixes that Fail" archetype:

## The Problem
A company struggles with poor communication between departments, slow decision-making, and employees working in isolated silos that hinder innovation and teamwork.

## The Quick Fix
Management decides to **eliminate private offices and cubicles**, creating a large **open office space** where everyone sits together at shared tables, believing this will naturally increase collaboration and communication.

## Initial Success
- **Real estate costs decrease significantly** with more efficient space utilization
- **Physical barriers are removed** between departments and hierarchy levels
- **Informal conversations increase** as people overhear discussions
- **Management feels more connected** to day-to-day operations through visibility
- **Modern, trendy appearance** improves company image and recruitment
- **Flexibility increases** for rearranging teams and workspace configurations

## The Unintended Consequences
Within 3-6 months, new problems emerge:

- **Constant noise and distractions** make focused work nearly impossible
- **Productivity plummets** as employees struggle to concentrate
- **Stress levels rise** from lack of privacy and constant surveillance feeling
- **Sick days increase** due to rapid spread of illnesses in shared space
- **Introvert employees suffer** particularly from overstimulation and lack of quiet space
- **Phone calls become disruptive** as private conversations disturb everyone nearby

## The Larger Problem Emerges
The open office creates a productivity and well-being crisis:

- **Employees wear headphones constantly** to block noise, actually reducing collaboration
- **Important conversations move to email** to avoid disturbing others or being overheard
- **Meeting room bookings explode** as people seek private spaces for any substantial work
- **Talent retention suffers** as employees seek jobs with better work environments
- **Quality of work declines** due to constant interruptions and inability to think deeply
- **Collaboration actually decreases** as people avoid disturbing colleagues or being disturbed

## The Vicious Cycle
Facing productivity problems, management often responds with:
- **More rules about noise levels** that further restrict natural interaction
- **Installing "phone booths"** and quiet zones that recreate the privacy they eliminated
- **Implementing "focus time" policies** where collaboration is discouraged during certain hours
- **Adding white noise machines** and sound dampening that increase costs
- **Creating more meeting rooms** that defeat the space efficiency gains
- **Mandating collaboration tools** to force the interaction that isn't happening naturally

## The System Structure
**Poor Collaboration** → **Open Office Design** → **Apparent Connectivity** → **Reduced Productivity & Actual Communication** → **Worse Collaboration** → **More Open Office "Solutions"**

## The Root Cause Solution
Improving collaboration might actually involve:
- Creating diverse spaces for different types of work (focus, collaboration, casual interaction)
- Building psychological safety so people feel comfortable sharing ideas
- Establishing clear communication processes and decision-making frameworks
- Training managers in collaborative leadership techniques
- Designing workflow processes that naturally require cross-department interaction
- Respecting individual work styles and providing choice in work environments

This example demonstrates how physically forcing interaction through environmental design can actually destroy the conditions necessary for genuine collaboration, creating a workplace that appears collaborative while systematically undermining the focus and comfort needed for quality teamwork.
