# Fixes that Fail: Eliminating Computer Programming to Focus on "Digital Literacy Basics"

Here's an educational technology example of the "Fixes that Fail" archetype:

## The Problem
A school district struggles with low student performance in basic computer skills assessments, with many students unable to use word processors, create presentations, or navigate basic software applications effectively.

## The Quick Fix
District administrators decide to **eliminate computer programming classes, coding clubs, and robotics programs** to redirect resources toward intensive training in "essential digital literacy" - focusing solely on Microsoft Office applications, typing skills, and basic internet navigation.

## Initial Success

- **Basic software proficiency scores improve** as students master PowerPoint and Word
- **Typing speeds increase significantly** from dedicated keyboarding instruction
- **Teacher training becomes simpler** focusing on familiar office applications
- **Technology costs decrease** without need for programming environments and specialized software
- **Administrative metrics show progress** in "digital literacy" benchmarks
- **Parents appreciate** students learning "practical" workplace skills

## The Unintended Consequences
Within 1-2 years, deeper technological learning problems emerge:

- **Logical thinking skills stagnate** without programming's step-by-step problem decomposition
- **Creative problem-solving abilities decline** as students become passive technology consumers
- **Mathematical concepts become abstract** without computational thinking applications
- **Student engagement with technology drops** from repetitive, uncreative software training
- **Advanced students become bored** with basic applications they mastered years ago
- **Career preparation suffers** as students miss exposure to growing tech fields

## The Larger Problem Emerges
The surface-level technology focus creates deeper learning deficits:

- **Critical thinking skills weaken** without debugging and algorithmic reasoning practice
- **Collaboration abilities decline** without team programming and maker projects
- **Digital literacy becomes superficial** - students can use apps but don't understand how technology works
- **STEM pipeline breaks down** as programming often serves as gateway to engineering and computer science
- **Innovation mindset disappears** replaced by passive consumption of existing tools
- **Economic opportunity gaps widen** as other districts prepare students for tech economy

## The Vicious Cycle
Facing continued poor problem-solving and analytical thinking, the district responds with:

- **More intensive office software drilling** with advanced Excel and presentation features
- **Additional keyboarding practice** to improve speed and accuracy metrics
- **Eliminating remaining "complex" technology** like video editing or web design
- **Focusing on "industry certifications"** in basic applications rather than foundational thinking
- **Hiring cheaper instructors** who know applications but not computational thinking
- **Creating more restrictive technology policies** that prevent creative exploration

## The System Structure
**Poor Basic Digital Skills** → **Eliminate Programming Education** → **Improved Application Proficiency** → **Reduced Computational Thinking & Creativity** → **Worse Problem-Solving & Innovation** → **More Basic Application Focus**

## The Root Cause Solution
Genuinely improving digital literacy might involve:

- Using programming projects to make abstract concepts concrete and engaging
- Teaching computational thinking through coding to improve logical reasoning across subjects
- Integrating programming with math, science, and art to show real-world applications
- Building creativity and innovation through maker projects and digital creation
- Developing problem-solving skills through debugging and iterative design processes
- Preparing students for economic opportunities in technology-driven careers
- Using coding as a tool to enhance rather than replace traditional digital literacy skills

This example demonstrates how focusing on surface-level technology skills while eliminating deeper computational thinking education can create students who are proficient with current applications but lack the foundational reasoning and creativity needed to adapt to new technologies, solve complex problems, or participate in innovation-driven careers.
