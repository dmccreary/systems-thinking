# Fixes that Fail: Urban Traffic Congestion

Here's a classic example of the "Fixes that Fail" archetype:

## The Problem

A city experiences increasing traffic congestion during rush hours, leading to commuter frustration and economic inefficiency.

## The Quick Fix
City planners decide to **add more highway lanes** to increase road capacity and reduce congestion.

## Initial Success

For a few months after completion, traffic flows more smoothly and commute times decrease. Politicians celebrate the successful infrastructure investment.

## The Unintended Consequences
However, within 1-2 years:

- **Induced demand**: More people choose to drive because the highways seem less congested
- **Urban sprawl**: Developers build new housing farther from the city center, knowing commuting is now "easier"
- **Reduced public transit usage**: People abandon buses and trains for the apparently faster highway option
- **Increased car dependency**: The city becomes more auto-centric in its design

## The Larger Problem Emerges

The additional traffic volume eventually **exceeds the new capacity**, creating:

- **Worse congestion than before** the highway expansion
- **Higher infrastructure maintenance costs**
- **Reduced funding for alternative transportation** like public transit
- **Environmental degradation** from increased emissions
- **More expensive future fixes** as the city is now locked into car-dependent infrastructure

## The System Structure

**Problem Symptom** → **Quick Fix** → **Temporary Relief** → **Unintended Consequences** → **Worse Original Problem**

This creates a reinforcing loop where each "fix" (adding more lanes) makes the fundamental problem worse, requiring ever-larger infrastructure investments that become increasingly expensive and disruptive.

## The Root Cause Solution
Instead of adding road capacity, addressing the root cause might involve:

- Investing in comprehensive public transit systems
- Implementing congestion pricing
- Promoting mixed-use development to reduce travel distances
- Creating bike infrastructure and walkable neighborhoods

The "Fixes that Fail" archetype teaches us to look for solutions that address underlying system structure rather than just treating visible symptoms.
