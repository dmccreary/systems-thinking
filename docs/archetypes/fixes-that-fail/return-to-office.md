# Fixes that Fail: Mandating Return-to-Office to Restore Company Culture

Here's a workplace policy example of the "Fixes that Fail" archetype:

## The Problem
After years of remote work, company executives notice declining employee engagement, weakened company culture, reduced mentorship of junior staff, and concerns about innovation and spontaneous collaboration.

## The Quick Fix
Leadership mandates that **all employees must return to the office full-time**, eliminating work-from-home options and requiring physical presence to "restore company culture" and improve collaboration.

## Initial Success
- **Office buildings are full again** with visible activity and energy
- **Executives feel more in control** seeing employees at their desks
- **Some spontaneous conversations resume** around coffee machines and hallways
- **Real estate investments are justified** as expensive office space gets utilized
- **Traditional management practices** can resume with direct oversight
- **New employee onboarding** appears more structured with in-person training

## The Unintended Consequences
Within 3-6 months, serious problems emerge:

- **Top talent begins leaving** for companies offering flexible work arrangements
- **Recruitment becomes difficult** as candidates reject inflexible policies
- **Commute stress increases** employee burnout and reduces work-life balance
- **Productivity drops** as employees spend hours commuting instead of working
- **Office politics intensify** with forced physical proximity and visibility pressure
- **Childcare crises emerge** for working parents who had adapted to remote arrangements

## The Larger Problem Emerges
The forced return creates a talent and morale crisis:

- **Brain drain accelerates** as experienced employees seek remote-friendly employers
- **Hiring costs skyrocket** to attract talent willing to work in inflexible environments
- **Employee satisfaction plummets** in surveys and exit interviews
- **Diversity decreases** as the policy disproportionately affects working parents and caregivers
- **Innovation actually declines** as stressed, resentful employees become less creative
- **Company reputation suffers** as word spreads about inflexible culture

## The Vicious Cycle
Facing talent exodus and declining performance, management often responds with:
- **Higher salaries and bonuses** to compensate for inflexibility, increasing costs
- **Stricter attendance monitoring** that further damages trust and culture
- **Team-building activities** and perks to artificially recreate engagement
- **Hiring lower-quality candidates** who accept the rigid terms
- **Blaming "lazy employees"** rather than examining policy effectiveness
- **Implementing hybrid policies reluctantly** but with complex restrictions that satisfy no one

## The System Structure
**Weak Company Culture** → **Forced Office Return** → **Apparent In-Person Engagement** → **Talent Loss & Decreased Morale** → **Weaker Culture & Performance** → **More Rigid Office Requirements**

## The Root Cause Solution
Genuinely improving company culture might involve:
- Creating flexible work arrangements that accommodate different work styles and life situations
- Investing in intentional culture-building activities and communication systems
- Training managers to lead effectively in hybrid environments
- Designing collaborative processes that work across different locations
- Building psychological safety and trust rather than relying on physical surveillance
- Measuring outcomes and results rather than time spent in specific locations
- Recognizing that culture comes from shared values and purpose, not physical proximity

This example demonstrates how using physical control to force cultural outcomes can destroy the very trust, autonomy, and employee satisfaction that create genuine company culture, while driving away the talented employees who have the most options to work elsewhere.
