# Fixes that Fail: Eliminating STEM Programs to Focus on "Core Basics"

Here's an educational resource allocation example of the "Fixes that Fail" archetype:

## The Problem
A struggling school district faces budget constraints and poor performance in standardized reading and math tests, with pressure from the state to improve "fundamental" literacy and numeracy scores or face intervention.

## The Quick Fix
District administrators decide to **eliminate STEM programs, computer science classes, engineering labs, and science electives** to redirect funding and classroom time toward intensive remedial reading and basic math instruction, focusing on "core basics first."

## Initial Success

- **More class time available** for reading and basic math drill and practice
- **Budget savings realized** from eliminating expensive lab equipment and specialized teachers
- **Administrative focus simplified** with fewer programs to manage
- **Basic skills test scores show modest improvement** from intensive drilling
- **Political pressure temporarily reduces** as leaders demonstrate focus on "fundamentals"
- **Scheduling becomes easier** with fewer specialized courses to coordinate

## The Unintended Consequences
Within 1-2 years, broader educational problems emerge:

- **Student engagement plummets** as hands-on, creative learning opportunities disappear
- **Critical thinking skills atrophy** without problem-solving and inquiry-based learning
- **Math becomes abstract and meaningless** without real-world applications from science and engineering
- **Technology literacy falls behind** as students lose exposure to modern tools and concepts
- **Gifted students become bored and disruptive** with no advanced or engaging coursework
- **Career preparation suffers** as students lose exposure to growing STEM fields

## The Larger Problem Emerges
The narrow focus creates cascading educational failures:

- **Reading comprehension actually declines** without science and technical texts to practice on
- **Mathematical reasoning weakens** without applied contexts from engineering and science projects
- **College readiness drops** as students enter higher education without laboratory or research experience
- **Dropout rates increase** among students who previously found motivation through STEM interests
- **Teacher quality deteriorates** as excellent STEM educators leave for districts with robust programs
- **Community economic development suffers** as local students aren't prepared for modern workforce

## The Vicious Cycle
Facing continued poor academic outcomes, the district often responds with:

- **Even more intensive basic skills drilling** consuming additional class time
- **Eliminating remaining "non-essential" courses** like advanced math and physics
- **Hiring cheaper, less qualified teachers** to focus on test preparation
- **Reducing graduation requirements** to make basic courses seem sufficient
- **Blaming student "lack of motivation"** rather than examining curriculum engagement
- **Creating separate "remedial tracks"** that further limit educational opportunities

## The System Structure
**Poor Basic Skills Performance** → **Eliminate STEM Programs** → **More Time for Basics** → **Reduced Engagement & Applied Learning** → **Worse Overall Academic Performance** → **More STEM Elimination**

## The Root Cause Solution

Genuinely improving basic skills might involve:

- Using STEM projects to make math and reading more engaging and meaningful
- Integrating literacy and numeracy instruction within science and engineering contexts
- Providing hands-on learning that helps students understand abstract concepts
- Creating real-world applications that show why basic skills matter
- Supporting teacher training to connect disciplines rather than isolating them
- Addressing root causes of academic struggle like poverty, trauma, or learning differences
- Building student interest and motivation through diverse, engaging coursework

This example demonstrates how eliminating engaging, applied learning opportunities in favor of narrow skill drilling can actually undermine the very basic skills the policy was designed to improve, while simultaneously destroying student motivation and preparation for modern careers that increasingly require STEM literacy.
