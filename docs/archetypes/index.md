# Systems Thinking Archetypes

We are using a classification system of archetypes that have the following eight categories.

## The Tragedy of the Commons

Multiple parties enjoying the benefits of a common resource 
do understand the impact they are having on sustaining resource.
As a result, they make selfish short-term decisions.
Eventually, this resource is exhausted, resulting in the shutdown 
of the activities of all parties in the system.

## Fixes that Fail

A quick-fix solution is rapidly implemented to address the symptoms
of an urgent problem without understanding the root cause
of the problem. This quick fix sets into motion unintended
consequences that are not evident at the start, but cause  problems
to the longer-term viability of the system.

## Limits to Growth

A given effort initially generates positive performance. 
However, over time the effort reaches a constraint that slows 
down the overall performance no matter how much energy is applied.

## Shifting the burden

A problem is addressed by a short-term and fundamental solution. 
The short-term solution produces side effects that affect the fundamental solution. 
As this occurs, the system's attention shifts to the short-term solution or to the side effects.


**Drifting goals**---As a gap between goal and actual performance is realized, the conscious decision is to lower the goal. The effect of this decision is a gradual decline in the system's performance.

**Growth and underinvestment**---Growth approaches a limit potentially avoidable with investments in capacity. However, a decision is made to not invest, resulting in performance degradation, which results in a decline in demand validating the decision not to invest.

**Success to the successful**---Two or more efforts compete for the same finite resources. The more successful effort gets a disproportionately larger allocation of resources to the detriment of the others.

**Escalation**---Parties take mutually threatening actions, which escalate their retaliation attempting to "one-up" one another.
