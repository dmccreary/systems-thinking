# Generative AI Prompts for Systems Thinking

Since 2017 large-language models have become incredibly powerful.
Every [seven months](https://dmccreary.github.io/tracking-ai-course/sims/ai-doubling-rate/) they are doubling their capabilities.

But how can we harness LLMs to enhance our systems thinking skills?  The answer lies in
using a series of carefully crafted prompts that help you extract exactly what
you need from these LLMs.  Although it is easy to have an LLM explain what "The Tragedy of the Commons" is, it is more difficult to figure out how to generate a high-quality [causal loop diagram](../glossary.md#causal-loop-diagrams) or have it generate a [graphic-novel style short story](../stories/tragedy-of-the-commons/index.md).  You can even generate a [simulation](../sims/toc/index.md) of the archetype.

The Prompts section of this book is here to suggest prompts that you can use to
both learn systems thinking as well as to use it as a teaching aid.

Note that both OpenAI and Claude provide project files that can be used to store rules for generating content.  We strongly suggest using these tools.

## Sample Archetype Examples

Archetypes are classic examples that are used to
teach systems thinking.  We can generate examples
of archetypes using generative AI tools.  Our
examples will be robust, consistent and extensible if
we use the templates provided.

## Generating Causal Loop Diagrams

There are many ways to draw causal loop diagrams (CLDs).
We have attempted to use the most broadly accepted
standards such as using the "R" and "B" symbols within
our loops to annotate reinforcing and balancing loops.
We have also created a JSON Schema to help guild
the process of building a consistent JSON file that
can be viewed by our CLD viewer tool.

## Learning Graphs

Learning graphs are directed graph networks that store
the concepts we need to master to learn systems thinking.
They should be reviewed by each instructor and loaded
into a context when appropriate for generating lesson plans
and other content.
