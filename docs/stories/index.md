## Moore's Law
The Geek Who Accidentally Predicted the Future

What if a quiet engineer's simple observation about computer chips became the most famous prediction in technology history—and then revealed a hidden pattern that explains why all exponential growth eventually hits a wall? In 1965, Gordon Moore was just trying to figure out why computer chips kept getting better, but his discovery launched the entire digital revolution, enabling everything from smartphones to social media to AI. For 50 years, Moore's Law drove the exponential progress that transformed our world, making Moore himself a tech legend who watched room-sized computers shrink to fit in our pockets. But here's the twist: this incredible success story is actually a perfect example of how even the most powerful growth eventually runs into limits—both the laws of physics (you can only make things so small before you're dealing with individual atoms!) and brutal economics (building chip factories now costs more than NASA's entire budget). This graphic novel tells the wild ride of how one man's simple chart became the roadmap for the digital age, and why understanding patterns like Moore's Law can help us navigate any situation where explosive growth meets immovable limits.

## Tragedy of the Commons

In 1833, the peaceful English village of Millhaven possessed 
a secret that had sustained five farming families for 
generations—a lush common pasture where all their 
cattle grazed freely and prospered together. 
But when Farmer Whitmore made a seemingly brilliant calculation that he could add just one more cow to boost his profits while sharing the cost with everyone else, 
he triggered a devastating chain reaction that 
would destroy everything. One by one, each 
neighbor followed the same "rational" logic, 
and within a single season, their shared paradise 
transformed into a barren wasteland of starving cattle 
and ruined families. This true story of how individual 
greed can destroy collective prosperity became the 
foundation for one of economics' most powerful 
theories—and its lessons echo in everything from 
climate change to internet overload, proving that 
sometimes being smart individually can make us all collectively stupid.
