## Tragedy of the Commons

![](./tragedy-of-the-commons/cover.jpg){width=400}

In 1833, the peaceful English village of Millhaven possessed 
a secret that had sustained five farming families for 
generations—a lush common pasture where all their 
cattle grazed freely and prospered together. 
But when Farmer Whitmore made a seemingly brilliant calculation that he could add just one more cow to boost his profits while sharing the cost with everyone else, 
he triggered a devastating chain reaction that 
would destroy everything. One by one, each 
neighbor followed the same "rational" logic, 
and within a single season, their shared paradise 
transformed into a barren wasteland of starving cattle 
and ruined families. This true story of how individual 
greed can destroy collective prosperity became the 
foundation for one of economics' most powerful 
theories—and its lessons echo in everything from 
climate change to internet overload, proving that 
sometimes being smart individually can make us all collectively stupid.
