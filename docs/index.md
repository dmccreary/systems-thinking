# Systems Thinking for All

![](img/cover.png)

Welcome to our website for systems thinkers!  The goal of this website
is to promote high quality systems thinking skills for a broad audience.

## Updated for AI Tools

Our 2023 release introduced a curated set of generative AI prompts.
We now feature a large collection of generative AI prompts
that help you use generative AI tools to create high-quality examples
of good systems thinking practices in your own context.

Whenever you are confronted with difficult problems we
have concrete examples of systems thinking to help you
achieve your goals.

We have also been asked to apply systems thinking
to break down organizational silos and share
data across business areas.  You will find
many resources on these topics as well
as how to accelerate the adoption of
Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) in your organization.

Please let me know if you have any questions or
feedback on this website.
