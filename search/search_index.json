But with this power comes complexity: unintended consequences, rapid feedback loops,  and deeply interconnected systems that often behave in unpredictable ways.  To thrive in this environment, one skill stands out as essential: systems thinking.</p> <p>What is systems thinking? Systems thinking is the ability to see the world not as isolated parts, but as interconnected wholes.  It means recognizing patterns, feedback loops, and the hidden structures driving behavior.  Where traditional thinking asks, \"What caused this problem?\" systems thinking asks,  \"What system created these conditions---and how might changes ripple through it?\"</p> <p>Why it matters in the AI era:</p> <ol> <li> <p>AI is systemic by nature. Algorithms interact with massive data ecosystems,  influencing social media trends, financial markets, and even healthcare outcomes.  A change in one part of the system---like a biased training dataset---can cascade into far-reaching consequences.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unintended consequences multiply. Well-intentioned AI applications (for example, automated hiring tools)  can reinforce inequality if we don't see the bigger system at play.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptability is survival. Both individuals and organizations need to anticipate how AI reshapes jobs, education, supply chains, and customer expectations---not in isolation, but as a living web of cause and effect.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"about/#for-teens","title":"For Teens","text":"<p>Today's students will grow into tomorrow's leaders in a world where AI is everywhere.

Systems thinking helps executives:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Anticipate second-order effects: A cost-cutting automation today may damage long-term customer trust tomorrow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance competing priorities: Profit, sustainability, and ethics are not isolated goals---they interact dynamically.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lead responsibly: With AI shaping lives at scale, executives must weigh not just quarterly returns, but the systemic impacts of their decisions on employees, communities, and society.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Bottom Line: AI is not a standalone technology---it is a force multiplier within complex human systems. Without systems thinking, we risk short-sighted solutions and cascading failures. With it, we can design strategies that are resilient, ethical, and sustainable.</p> <p>Whether you are a teenager imagining your future or an executive charting your company's path, systems thinking is no longer optional.  It is the literacy of the AI age---the lens that allows us to see not just faster machines, but the futures we are collectively creating.</p>"},{"location":"about/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>I was originally introduced to formal Systems Thinking and Complex Adaptive Systems by my good friend Arun Batchu. Arun and I were always talking about the power of taking a deeper look not just about things but the connections between things.</p> <p>I have been teaching systems thinking courses in the fall of 2015. At the time these courses were small and customized to the needs of individual groups. Most of my work was teaching Systems Thinking to technologists. Many of the examples focused on the need for hidden enterprise data infrastructure such as metadata management and a robust data governance system that made data scientists more productive. However, my content was basic PowerPoint slide.</p> <p>In 2017 I started to migrate my systems thinking training content to an on-line formats and I started to roll out more formal classes to managers and executives at Optum and United Health Group.</p> <p>When GPT-3 was released in June 2020 I began aggressively using it to generate causal information.  Although it could not create high-quality causal loop diagrams, I was convinced that there was deep causal knowledge buried in LLMs.  Our jobs was to just figure out a way to get in out and make it useful to students of systems thinking.</p> <p>Finally in Feb. of 2021 I started sharing my systems thinking training content.  The online content was still incomplete, but I started getting positive feedback from a diverse audience.</p> <p>In 2022 I was asked to deliver a workshop on Graph Systems Thinking. This was one of my first chances to help other graph evangelists build a deeply holistic view of information in an organization.</p> <p>At UHG/Optum I was also been asked to apply systems thinking to break down organizational silos and share data across business areas.  I want to give my deep appreciation to John Santelli (then the CIO of Optum) for his support rolling out my Systems Thinking courses to management at UHG and Oputm.</p> <p>You will find many resources on these topics as well as how to accelerate the adoption of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) in your organization.</p>"},{"location":"about/#relationship-between-systems-thinking-and-enterprise-knowledge-graphs","title":"Relationship Between Systems Thinking and Enterprise Knowledge Graphs","text":"<p>I believe strongly that many business people in Fortune 500 organizations today only have a pinhole view of information flows in their organization.

They originally used a social convention where the cows graze.  This was the custom in English villages at the time.  One one or more farmers break the convention the common land becomes over used, the grass dies, and it is no longer useful to anyone in the village.</p> <p>In graph systems thinking (GST) we think of commons as a central area that each business unit puts shared information about shared customers.  If business units only want to read data but not publish their data there is no clear integrated view of a customer.

Make the default text size be 16. Create a five layer stair step diagram of a capability-maturity model. The first layer is at the bottom and covers the width of the canvas. The top layer in smaller at the top right. As the user hovers the mouse over each layer, a detailed text description of that layer will appear below the steps. The rectangle colors will be L1: red, L2: orange, L3: yellow, L4: green, L5: blue. The text color in the L2: orange and L3: yellow will be black. The text in the red, green and blue will be white. Use the following text for the level definitions and descriptions:</p> <p>Level 1 - Initial Initial is characteristic of processes at this level that they are (typically) undocumented and in a state of dynamic change, tending to be driven in an ad hoc, uncontrolled and reactive manner by users or events. This provides a chaotic or unstable environment for the processes. (Example - a surgeon performing a new operation a small number of times - the levels of negative outcome are not known). Level 2 - Repeatable Repeatable is characteristic of this level of maturity that some processes are repeatable, possibly with consistent results. Process discipline is unlikely to be rigorous, but where it exists it may help to ensure that existing processes are maintained during times of stress. Level 3 - Defined Defined is characteristic of processes at this level that there are sets of defined and documented standard processes established and subject to some degree of improvement over time. These standard processes are in place. The processes may not have been systematically or repeatedly used - sufficient for the users to become competent or the process to be validated in a range of situations. This could be considered a developmental stage - with use in a wider range of conditions and user competence development the process can develop to next level of maturity. Level 4 - Managed (Capable) Managed is characteristic of processes at this level that, using process metrics, effective achievement of the process objectives can be evidenced across a range of operational conditions. The suitability of the process in multiple environments has been tested and the process refined and adapted. Process users have experienced the process in multiple and varied conditions, and are able to demonstrate competence. The process maturity enables adaptions to particular projects without measurable losses of quality or deviations from specifications. Process Capability is established from this level. (Example - surgeon performing an operation hundreds of times with levels of negative outcome approaching zero). Level 5 - Optimizing (Efficient) It is a characteristic of processes at this level that the focus is on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological changes/improvements. At maturity level 5, processes are concerned with addressing statistical common causes of process variation and changing the process (for example, to shift the mean of the process performance) to improve process performance. This would be done at the same time as maintaining the likelihood of achieving the established quantitative process-improvement objectives.</p> <p>```</p>"},{"location":"colophon/","title":"Colophon","text":"<p>A brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as how the ideas were generated, how the text was stored and how the content was transmitted to the publisher.</p> <p>We used GPT-3 to generate outlines and provide concept definitions.

It offers managers a framework for understanding complex situations and the dynamics those situations produce.

The program is intended to give participants the tools and confidence to manage organizations with full understanding and solid strategy.</p> <p>Participants will experience the Beer Game, a table game, developed by Jay Forrester. Played with pen, paper, printed plastic tablecloths, and poker chips, it simulates the supply chain of the beer industry. In so doing, it illuminates aspects of system dynamics, a signature mode of MIT thought: it illustrates the nonlinear complexities of supply chains and the way individuals are circumscribed by the systems in which they act.</p> <p>You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

This process results in novel outcomes that are more than the sum of the system's parts, often observed in complex adaptive systems across various fields.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have seen databases grow from tens of thousands of records to hundreds of billions of records.  With each order-of-magnitude increase in size new insights emerge.</p> <p>What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sharpness of Transition - the seemingly instantaneous switch from boring to deep insights.  From mundane operational reports to high-impact decision support.</p> </li> <li> <p>Their Unpredictably - the rate of enterprise knowledge graph insights is unpredictable, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable as knowledge graph models scale.  Getting accountants to place a value on future insights is a challenge.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Within the framework of systems thinking and complex adaptive systems, emergence refers to the phenomenon where larger entities, patterns, and behaviors arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities that themselves do not exhibit such properties. This concept is central to understanding how complex systems evolve and adapt over time, often in unpredictable ways. The interactions among the system's components can lead to the emergence of new properties and behaviors that are not inherent in the individual components but are a result of their collective interplay.</p> <p>In the context of building centralized enterprise knowledge graphs, emergence plays a crucial role in shaping strategic thinking for several reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Understanding Complexity and Interconnectivity: Enterprise knowledge graphs aim to represent and store complex information in an interconnected, accessible manner. Recognizing the emergent properties of the system can help in understanding how different pieces of information relate to each other and influence the whole system. This understanding is critical for accurately mapping relationships and dependencies within the knowledge graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptability and Evolution: As enterprises evolve, so do their knowledge needs and the structure of their knowledge graphs. Emergent properties highlight the need for these graphs to be adaptable and capable of evolving. This adaptability is essential for incorporating new information, relationships, and patterns that arise as the organization grows and changes. Strategic thinking, in this case, involves planning for flexibility and scalability from the outset.</p> </li> <li> <p>Innovation and Discovery: The concept of emergence encourages a strategic approach that is open to innovation and discovery. As new patterns and insights emerge from the data and relationships encoded in the knowledge graph, organizations can identify unforeseen opportunities or challenges. This can lead to innovative approaches to problem-solving and decision-making, based on insights that were not apparent without the holistic view provided by the knowledge graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decision-making and Strategy: Emergent properties can significantly impact decision-making and strategic planning. By understanding and anticipating how certain inputs or changes might affect the larger system, leaders can make more informed decisions. For instance, recognizing potential emergent behaviors might influence the design of the knowledge graph, such as incorporating mechanisms for real-time updates or feedback loops to capture dynamic changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Risk Management: Identifying and understanding emergent properties can also help in risk management. By analyzing how different elements of the knowledge graph interact, organizations can anticipate potential issues or bottlenecks and develop strategies to mitigate these risks before they escalate.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"intro/ch-05-emergence/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>The bottom line is that systems thinking can be difficult for newcomers.
