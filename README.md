A comprehensive set of resources for teaching systems thinking to a wide variety of audiences from high-school students to business executives. This version also has extensive use of causal loop graph diagrams and examples from areas like business, education, and healthcare.  We also have extensive content on how break down organizational silos. This interactive documentation site includes educational content, simulations, and AI prompts to help both students and professionals apply systems thinking concepts.

- Capability maturity model strategies
- Real-world case studies and examples

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment tool (conda, venv, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmccreary/systems-thinking.git
   cd systems-thinking
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv mkdocs-env
   source mkdocs-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: mkdocs-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

5. Open your browser to http://localhost:8000

### Building for Production

```bash
mkdocs build
```

### Generate E-book

```bash
./docs/mk-ebook.sh
```
Output will be available at `/tmp/full-book.epub`
